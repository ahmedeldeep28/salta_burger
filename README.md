# Salta Burger
##### Project is a website for a fast food and drinks restaurant

## Features

- The site is responsive to all screens
- authentication system

## Tech

Techniques I used to develop the site:

- [ReactJS] - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Redux toolki] - state management
- [React-bootstrap] - The most popular front-end framework
Rebuilt for React
- [React-toastify] - A library that offers you creative warning forms
- [Axios] - Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser
- [Formik] - Formik is the world's most popular open source form library for React and React Native


And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
